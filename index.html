    <p><b><i>I learned that css has various types which includes, the inline css, internal css, external css. where the inline is used within an element tag and an internal css is used just below the <heading> tag using a style tag to enclose all the CSS being added. We also have the CSS selector which includes: the element selector, ID selector, class selector, and the attribute selector. CSS also has major properties they iknclude: the color, background-color, margin, padding, border etc. Basically CSS gives the web it's look and layout.Cascading Style Sheets are an important way to control how your web pages look. CSS controls the fonts, text, colors, backgrounds, margins, and layout. CSS offers several significant advantages over alternative approaches to web design.</i></b></p>
